# session_2 (Files for workshop policy gradient and actor critic algorithms)
This section provides insights on policy based methods and how they can be used for training on different applications

## To run policy gradient algorithm on cartpole demo (training & test)
``` 
    cd rl_wksp/session_2
    python policy_grad_wk.py
```

## To run actor critic algorithm on cartpole demo (training & test)
``` 
    cd rl_wksp/session_2
    python actor_critic_wk.py
```
